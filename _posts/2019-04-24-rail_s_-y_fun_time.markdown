I had a really great time building my Rails project. Due to the birth of some new nephews (twins!) and the travel that ensued my schedule and routine was definitely tested -  but here I am, about to hit the submit button on another completed project.  

I’d been planning a version of this project since before starting Flatiron School. I live in Colorado and I love camping, therefore every weekend (when there isn’t 4 feet of snow on the ground) I go sleep outside. Camping in Colorado goes much the way fishing anywhere goes, the longer you do it the more secret spots you accumulate. I wanted a way to log these secret spots and share them with my friends and vice versa. The end result is Incampment, a basic Rails app that allows a user to sign-in, create new camping spots and leave reviews on others. Future functionality would include a friends network that would allow you to share certain spots with specific friends and generally have more control over who views your campsites – they’re secret after all….

**Some Thoughts on Preparation. **

Through these first three projects I’ve really come to appreciate the value of preparation. I started out this time by taking an entire day to sketch out the functionality of the app, map the object relationships and even write out the routes I wanted to be using. When I started building and ran into confusion I would look at these notes and they helped guide me to the right solution. I can’t stress enough how much this helped. 

I also spent some time going back over some lectures and labs from the trickier and earlier sections to refresh my memory. I find it a little difficult to retain everything from week to week so along with taking good notes along the way this really helped in smoothing out the process.

As Avi suggests in just about every lecture, I used Gliffy to map out my object relationships and make some notes on how they would interact. TIP: if you have an .edu email address you can get FOUR YEARS of Gliffy for FREE. Don’t believe me?

Me catching up to my cohort in JavaScript like:

It’s time to jump into JavaScript – something I thought was forever in the future three months ago. Time has sped by and I’m continuing to learn an incredible amount everyday. Can’t think of a better way to end this than a ;
