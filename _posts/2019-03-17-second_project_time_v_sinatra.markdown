What an incredibly fun and frustrating week. The second project for Flatiron School is to build a very basic web app using [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/). I decided on a name before a concept: downlink. In my minimal spare time I've been reading alot about NASA's [Deep Space Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Deep_Space_Network) and the idea of a satellite downlink stuck with me for some reason. The promotion of mental health awareness is also a subject very important to me so I decided to try and combine the two. 

From the README:

> Downlink is based on the widely accepted idea that keeping track of your thoughts and emotions is an effective means of managing your overall mental health. Getting these feelings out of your head and down into words will help you prioritize problems or fears - tracking these issues day-to-day allows you to better identify and control behaviors and triggers.
> 
> Downlink is meant to be a short-form journal. Quickly record thoughts, feelings, or emotions. Set your signal strength to match your overall mood.

The main focus of the project was to create a CRUD app with user accounts. My main focus starting out was getting the functionality working, I left everything in vanilla HTML until I could persist and retrieve data from my database. I've learned that while it's good to have ambition and vision it's also good to get things done on time. For anyone that hasn't started their Sinatra project I highly recommend starting out with [Corneal](https://github.com/thebrianemory/corneal), a ruby gem written by a former student that essentially sets up your entire file tree and sets a few other key functions up for you. 

I've worked with HTML in the past but this week also included a crash course in CSS - I spent a lot of time just playing around with elements until I got it right (my preferred learning method). Overall I'm proud of the final result, learned an *incredible* amount and had an absolute blast (space pun?).
