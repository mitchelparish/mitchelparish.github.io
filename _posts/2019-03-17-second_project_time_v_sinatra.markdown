What an incredibly fun and frustrating week. The second project for Flatiron School is to build a very basic web app using [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/). I decided on a name before a concept: downlink. In my minimal spare time I've been reading alot about NASA's [Deep Space Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Deep_Space_Network) and the idea of a satellite downlink stuck with me for some reason. The promotion of mental health awareness is also a subject very important to me so I decided to try and combine the two. 

From the README:

```Downlink is based on the widely accepted idea that keeping track of your thoughts and emotions is an effective means of managing your overall mental health. Getting these feelings out of your head and down into words will help you prioritize problems or fears - tracking these issues day-to-day allows you to better identify and control behaviors and triggers.

Downlink is meant to be a short-form journal. Quickly record thoughts, feelings, or emotions. Set your signal strength to match your overall mood.```

For anyone that hasn't started their Sinatra project I highly recommend starting out with [Corneal](https://github.com/thebrianemory/corneal), a ruby gem written by a former student that essentially sets up your entire file-tree and sets a few other key functions for you. 

I learned an *incredible* amount this week and I can't get over how much fun (most) of it was. I've worked with HTML in the past but this week also included a crash course in CSS and I spent so much time just playing around with things and had a blast. Usually with programming when I'm having fun I know something hard and frustrating is around the corner - so it's time for a celebratory beer before Monday arrives.
