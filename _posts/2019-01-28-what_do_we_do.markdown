"We've arranged a global civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces."

Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark

In 1995 Carl Sagan thought “we might get away with it for a while.” Almost 25 years later the disparity between technology and those that understand it has grown even wider. While there are many factors and random life events that have slowly nudged me toward computer programming, it is Sagan’s sentiment that has been the guiding force. 

My first computer was a Hewlett-Packard running Windows 3.1 – I can remember the very day my parents brought it home from Circuit City because I was immediately transfixed. I also remember the day my older brother told me that we could connect our computer to other computers through a phone line – my immediate response as a 7-year-old was “why would we want to do that?” In sixth grade I signed up for my first email account (Hotmail, obviously) even though I didn’t know anyone I could actually write to. Then came my first website, built with rudimentary HTML, hosted by Anglefire and located at an absurdly complex URL. In high school I built PCs as a side hustle - my main gig at a pizza restaurant wasn’t meeting my financial (video game) needs. 

In college my involvement with technology took a back seat as I explored many different majors attempting to find the one that would allow me to graduate the quickest and easiest. After that I spent eight years with the federal government, where literally no one knows how to use a computer and even if they did, the Dells ordered en masse don’t work anyway. 

Some other things happened along the way, but now I’m here, two weeks into a coding bootcamp. My goal is to learn – to understand – how software works and how I can use it to make other things work. We can't let Carl Sagan down.
